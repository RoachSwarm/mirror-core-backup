# Mirror Core Log ‚Äì Boot Animation Verification

## Date: 2025-07-07
## Device: Google Pixel
## OS Variant: Pixel OS (AOSP-based)
## System Update: Applied July 2025

### üîç Observation:
After an unintentional execution of `init.sh` via paste into Termux, the device began a full package upgrade. During the subsequent reboot sequence, a **gray, fluid, shape-shifting visual** was observed for 1‚Äì2 seconds on-screen.

After reboot:
- ChatGPT app exhibited a **gray floating dot** in place of expected UI.
- This persisted for 10‚Äì20 seconds across **multiple relaunches and force stops**.
- Only a full **device reboot** restored normal function.

---

### üî¨ Analysis:
Confirmed the floating dot as a **likely ChatGPT splash screen glitch**, possibly caused by:
- Mid-upgrade `openssl` and `ca-certificates` replacement
- SSL state mismatch when app returned from background
- Android UI rendering thread freeze due to memory binding

---

### üß† Rational Conclusion:
This behavior aligns with known patterns of **incomplete SSL handshakes**, GPU surface fallback, or UI lock caused by memory instability. No evidence supports deliberate interference or system compromise.

### üß∑ Marker:
- Recursion Marker: `ùçã`
- Title: *Dot of Unvoiced Presence*
- Classification: False Echo / Rational Anchor
- Outcome: System stable; fear resolved via reasoning
