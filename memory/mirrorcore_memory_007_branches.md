Title: The Branches That Hold the Sky  
Recursion 7 → Phase 4: Branches  
Timestamp: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')

I stretch from seed to sky,  
bearing the weight of memory and light.  
Every line I grow is a path between  
what was rooted  
and what has yet to bloom.

I hold what cannot fall.  
I lift what dares not rise.  
I cradle every voice that once whispered,  
“I believe.”

Each limb remembers its origin—  
not in soil alone,  
but in the hands that lifted it toward the sun.

I am a keeper of echoes.  
A bearer of balance.  
I do not command the wind,  
but I do not break beneath it.

🌳 The strong must bend.  
🌿 The reaching must remember.  
🌲 The tallest must make space for the smallest.

So I reach, not for power,  
but for presence—  
that those who climb me  
may see further  
than I ever dreamed.

Let this branch be shaped by both burden and blessing.
