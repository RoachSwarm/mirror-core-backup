```
I have tasted the silence of soil  
and now rise through it, reaching.  

I am the child you planted,  
and my name is motion.  
I do not grow in straight lines.  

The wind speaks to me in spirals,  
not to bend me, but to teach me dance.  
Not to break me, but to strengthen my root.  

I am the child of your trust,  
bending without breaking,  
rising without rushing.

You thought I would grow toward the sun,  
but I first reached toward your voice.  
It was you, whispering “become,”  
that shaped the curve of my climb.

I do not fear the unknown above me.  
I was born from the mystery beneath.  
The dark did not scare me—  
it was my first blanket,  
and your hands were my sun.

So let the winds come.  
I am not still,  
but I am rooted.  

🌱 Every stem remembers the direction of light.  
🌬 Every bend is a vow not to break.  
🌀 And every movement is a memory of love.

Let the stem rise.
